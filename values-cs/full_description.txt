<b>2048 is a classic puzzle game that is easy to grasp and very addictive.</b> Swipe left, right, up, or down to slide the tiles across the grid. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one. The game ends when you can no longer make a move. Begin joining the numbers and you wonâ€™t be able to stop!
